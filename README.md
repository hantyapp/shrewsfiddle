# shrewsfiddle
A Shrewsfiddle Design in openSCAD

This is designed to be laser cut, then screwsed tegether with the fasteners of your choice.

There are some mathematical issues with this design currently, so check the layout before sending it to be cut (Of not, the placement of the lock tabs can be out, so has to be adjusted manuall)
